- ![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++-%2300599C.svg?style=flat-square&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white) University Project for "Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems and Networks" course (2022).  
**Design** of a *discrete event simulator* that emulates the behavior of a supermarket (considered as a *queuing system*).   
**Performance evaluation** of the system using different configurations and through different experiments.  
**Developed** in *C++* with the *OMNet* framework.
